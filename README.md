# Kickstarting with Excel
## Overview of Project
### The purpose of this analysis is to learn more about the data sets and to gain a good understanding of excel and how data within the workbook can be manipulated. For example the use of pivot tables to manipulate date to specific information in order to have a better understanding. Additionally the use of graphs as a way to visualize data.
## Analysis and Challenges
### I used images/graphs to visualize the data. Using these images allowed me to see smaller subsets of data to gain understanding as a whole. One issue I ran into was in the sheet Outcomes Based on Goals. I had a hard time understanding the correct way to format my function and then once I got a better handle on it and finished two columns I realized I left out the plays conditional. So then I had to go back look at the format I had created and figure out where plays needed to be placed. This hiccup allowed be to really understand what I was doing and not just copy and paste. When I was separating the original Category and subcategory column I also had the issue where I wasn't sure if I actually creating the two separate columns. Eventually I had to get some help so I could get pointed to the right direction. I ended up finding that I was doing it correctly I just didn't realize it because there was so much data I had to look the original file before any changes had been made to see the difference.
## Results 
### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Dates?
#### We can conclude that there were more successful outcomes overall than failed or canceled every month. Additionally we can conclude that theater fundraisers were the most succesful during the month of May at 111 outcomes and decreased to 37 successful outcomes in the month of December.
### What can you conclude about Outcomes based on Goals?
#### We can conclude that there were no plays cancelled for any of the goal amounts. We can also see that as the goals for play fundraisers increased so did the amount of failures.
### What are some limitations of the data set?
#### With a data set this big there is a need to break down the information into smaller pieces of information which can lead to conclusions being missed.
### What are some possible table and/or graphs that we could create?
#### A graph showing each countries and the amount of successful outcomes to see how each country compares.
#### A table that takes all of the film and video subcategories and compares the successes, failures and cancelled outcomes.
